Project Summary :

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction - As a trainee learning web development, I have developed a user-friendly food delivery application.
This project highlights my skills with React.js for a smooth interface, Node.js and Express.js for the server-side logic, and MongoDB for real-time data handling. The application features easy sign-ups and sign-ins with secure authentication, a dynamic menu for exploring and selecting products, and customizable order and add to cart options. Additionally, it includes secure payments through Stripe, providing a practical and efficient solution for modern food delivery.
1. Technologies Used :
Node.js
•	Role: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It’s lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.
•	How It’s Used: In your project, Node.js powers the server, handling requests from the client (browser) and responding with the necessary data. It ensures that your food delivery website can manage multiple users and requests simultaneously.

Express.js
•	Role: Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building and managing web server functionalities by providing a robust set of features.
•	How It’s Used: Express.js helps in setting up the server routes and middleware. For example, it manages user sign-up, sign-in, and other API endpoints, making it easier to handle HTTP requests and responses.
MongoDB
•	Role: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. This allows for quick and easy data retrieval and is well-suited for applications requiring scalability.
•	How It’s Used: MongoDB stores user information, product details, cart data, and order history. It updates in real-time, reflecting changes like new user registrations, cart updates, and order completions instantly.
React.js
•	Role: React.js is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications.
•	How It’s Used: React.js is used to build the client-side components of your food delivery website. It handles the user interface, including the sign-up and sign-in forms, product display, and cart management, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
2. Functionality and Real-Time Data Handling
Sign Up
•	Functionality: Users can sign up by entering their name, email, and password. The system validates these inputs (e.g., email format, password length).
•	How It Works: When users submit their information, the server (Node.js and Express.js) checks the data and, if valid, saves it to MongoDB. The real-time nature of MongoDB ensures that user data is stored and available immediately.
Sign In
•	Functionality: After sign-up, users receive a token for authentication. This token is used to log in and access the application.
•	How It Works: Upon login, the server verifies the token and, if valid, grants access and redirects the user to the home page. This process is efficient and ensures that user sessions are managed securely.
Navbar
•	Functionality: The navigation bar includes links to different sections like Home, Menu, Mobile App, and Contact Us.
•	How It Works: The navbar is built using React.js, making it dynamic and responsive. Users can navigate through the site without reloading the page, enhancing the overall user experience.
Menu Page
•	Functionality: Users can view and explore the menu, filtered by categories such as salads, rolls, and sweets.
•	How It Works: React.js renders the menu items from data fetched from MongoDB. Users can interact with the menu, and React.js updates the view in real-time as users select products.
Select Product
•	Functionality: Users can select products, adjust quantities, and add items to their cart.
•	How It Works: When a user selects a product, React.js updates the cart interface. This data is sent to the server, where Express.js handles it and updates MongoDB with the current cart details in real-time.
Add Product to Cart
•	Functionality: Products added to the cart are stored and updated in real-time.
•	How It Works: Each cart action (add, update, remove) is processed by the server and immediately reflected in MongoDB. Changes in the cart are visible to users instantly due to MongoDB’s real-time capabilities.
Proceed to Checkout
•	Functionality: Users review their cart, add delivery details, and proceed to payment.
•	How It Works: React.js displays the cart totals and collects delivery information. This data is sent to the server, which updates MongoDB and prepares the order for payment.
Proceed to Payment
•	Functionality: Users finalize their purchase using a payment gateway.
•	How It Works: The payment process is handled by Stripe, a payment gateway. React.js integrates with Stripe to facilitate payment, and the server ensures that payment information is securely processed and recorded.
Payment Gateway Integration
•	Functionality: Stripe handles payments.
•	How It Works: Stripe is integrated into your website using React.js for the front-end and communicates with your server. Stripe processes transactions securely and updates your database once payment is confirmed.
Summary
In completing this project, I successfully developed a comprehensive food delivery web application as a part of my training, demonstrating my ability to integrate React.js for a seamless user interface, Node.js and Express.js for efficient server management, and MongoDB for real-time data handling. The application offers a smooth user experience from sign-up and menu exploration to secure checkout and payment via Stripe, showcasing practical solutions and modern web development skills.
